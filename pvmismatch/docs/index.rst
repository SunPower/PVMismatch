Announcements
-------------
Thanks to Bennet Meyers you should see huge memory and speed improvements since
new cell, module and string objects are only created when they are needed to
differentiate cells by irradiance or temperature. However this can lead to
unexpected behavior when changing other cell properties without first making a
copy of the original cell.
